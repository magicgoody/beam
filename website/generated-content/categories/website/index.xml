&lt;p>One of the major benefits of Apache Beam is the fact that it unifies both
both batch and stream processing into one powerful model. In fact, this unification
is so important, the name Beam itself comes from the union of &lt;strong>B&lt;/strong>atch + str&lt;strong>EAM&lt;/strong> = Beam&lt;/p>
&lt;p>When the project started, we wanted a logo which was both appealing and visually
represented this unification.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Thanks to the &lt;strong>amazing&lt;/strong> work of Stephanie Smythies, the Apache Beam project
now has a logo.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;em>drum roll&lt;/em> - &lt;strong>Presenting, the Apache Beam Logo!&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;img src="/images/beam_logo_s.png" alt="Apache Beam Logo">
&lt;p>We are excited about this logo because it is &lt;strong>simple&lt;/strong>, &lt;strong>bright&lt;/strong>, and shows the
unification of bath and streaming, as beams of light, within the &amp;lsquo;B&amp;rsquo;. We will base
our future website and documentation design around this logo and its coloring. We
will also make various permutations and resolutions of this logo available in the
coming weeks. For any questions or comments, send an email to the &lt;code>dev@&lt;/code> email list
for Apache Beam.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
