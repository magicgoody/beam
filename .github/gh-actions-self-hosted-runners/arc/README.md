# Actions Runner Contoler 

# About
Check out the docs at https://github.com/actions/actions-runner-controller/blob/master/docs/about-arc.md

# Installing
1. Create a file called `overrides.tfvars` with the following contents:
```
project_id = "PROJECT_ID"                             # google PROJECT_ID that you want to deploy in
region = "gcp_region"                                 # GCP region for the network
zone = "europe-west3-c"                               # GCP zone for the nodes
min_main_node_count = "1"                             # Minimal and initial node count for main pool
max_main_node_count = "5"                             # Maximal node count for main pool
environment = "vdjerek"                               # Name of the environment. Used as a prefix like dev- stag- anything-
ingress_domain = "fqdn"                               # FQDN for webhook ingress
organization = "org"                                  # Github Organization to use runners in
repository = "repo"                                   # Repository to use runners in
github_app_id = "app_id"                              # Github App app_id
github_app_installation_id = "install_id"             # Github App install id
github_app_private_key_path = "absolute_path_to_key"  # Absolute filesystem path to .pem keyfile generated in the Github App
deploy_webhook = "false"                              # Terraform to deploy the scaling webhook
```

2. Create a google bucket for storing the terraform state. Make sure you disable public access and allow your account to access it. 

3.  Init terraform with: 
```
terraform init -backend-config="bucket=bucket_name"
```
4. Terraform apply
```
terraform apply -var-file=overrides.tfvar
```
